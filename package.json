  "description": "This repository contains peer-reviewed libraries for password storage in PHP, C#, Ruby, Java, and Node.js. Passwords are \"hashed\" with PBKDF2 (64,000 iterations of SHA1 by default) using a cryptographically-random salt. The implementations are compatible with each other, so you can, for instance, create a hash in PHP and then verify it in C#.",
