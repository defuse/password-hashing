Secure Password Storage v2.0
=============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/defuse/password-hashing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/defuse/password-hashing)

This repository containes peer-reviewed libraries for password storage in PHP,
C#, Ruby, Java, and Node.js. Passwords are "hashed" with PBKDF2 (64,000 iterations of
SHA1 by default) using a cryptographically-random salt. The implementations are
compatible with each other, so you can, for instance, create a hash in PHP and
then verify it in C#.

Should you use this code?
--------------------------

This code uses the PBKDF2 algorithm to protect passwords. Better technologies
for protecting passwords exist today, like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2. Before
using this code, you should try to find a well-reviewed and carefully-made
implementation of one of those algorithms for the language that you are using.
These algorithms are "memory hard," meaning that they don't just need a lot of
CPU power to compute, they also require a lot of memory (unlike PBKDF2). By
using a memory hard algorithm, your passwords will be better protected.

One thing you could do would be to use
[libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) to [hash your passwords with
scrypt](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/password_hashing/index.html). It has
bindings available for many languages.

Since there are better options, this code is now in "maintenance mode." Only
bugs will be fixed, no new features will be added. It is currently safe to use,
but using libsodium would be better.

Usage
------

You should not store users' passwords in plain text on your servers. Nor should
you even store them in encrypted form. The correct way to store a password is to
store something created from the password, which we'll call a "hash." Hashes
don't allow you to recover the password, they only let you check if a password
is the same as the one that created the hash.

There are a lot of subtle details about password hashing that this library hides
from you. You don't need to worry about things like "salt" with this library. It
takes care of all of that for you.

To implement a user login system, you need two parts: creating new accounts, and
logging in to existing accounts. When you create a new account, your code will
create a hash of the new account's password and save it somewhere. When you log
in to an account, your code will use the hash to check if the login password is
correct.

To create a hash, when a new account is added to your system, you call the
`CreateHash()` method provided by this library. To verify a password, you call
`VerifyPassword()` method provided by this library.

Here is more specific documentation for both functions. The behavior should be
the same for all of the implementations (although the method names differ
slightly). If one implementation behaves differently than another, that is
a bug, and should be filed in the GitHub issue tracker.

### CreateHash(password)

**Preconditions:**

- You're intending to create a new account, or the password to an existing
  account is being changed.
- `password` is the password for the new account, or the new password for an
  existing account.

**Postconditions:**

- `CreateHash()` gives you a string which can be used with `VerifyPassword()` to
  check, in the future, if a password is the same as the `password` given to
  this call.

**Obligations:**

- Store the string `CreateHash()` returns to you in a safe place. If an attacker
  can modify your hashes, they will be able to change them to, for instance, the
  hash of "1234", and then log in to any account. If an attacker can view your
  hashes, they can begin cracking them (by trying to guess-and-check passwords).

**Exceptions:**

- `CannotPerformOperationException`: If this exception is thrown, it means
  something is wrong with the platform your code is running on, and it's not
  safe to create a hash. For example, if your system's random number generator
  doesn't work properly, this kind of exception will be thrown.

### VerifyPassword(password, correctHash)

**Preconditions:**

- Someone is logging in to a user account which has been created in the past.
- `password` is the password provided by the person trying to log in.
- `correctHash` is the hash of the account's correct password, made with
  `CreateHash()` when the account was created or when its password was last
  changed. Make sure you are providing the hash for the correct user account!
- `correctHash` hasn't been seen by or changed by an attacker since it was
  created.

**Postconditions:**

- True is returned if the password provided by the person logging in is correct.
  False is returned if not.

**Obligations:**

- Make sure the `correctHash` you're giving is for the right account. If you
  give a hash for the wrong account, it would let someone log into Alice's
  account using Bob's password!

**Exceptions:**

- `CannotPerformOperationException`: If this exception is thrown, it means
  something is wrong with the platform your code is running on, and for some
  reason it's not safe to verify a password on it.
- `InvalidHashException`: The `correctHash` you gave was somehow corrupted. Note
  that some ways of corrupting a hash are impossible to detect, and their only
  symptom will be that `VerifyPassword()` will return false even though the
  correct password was given. So `InvalidHashException` is not guaranteed to be
  thrown if a hash has been changed, but *if it is thrown* then you can be sure
  that the hash was changed.

Customization
--------------

Each implementation provides several constants that can be changed. **Only
change these if you know what you are doing, and have help from an expert**:

- `PBKDF2_HASH_ALGORITHM`: The hash function PBKDF2 uses. By default, it is SHA1
  for compatibility across implementations, but you may change it to SHA256 if
  you don't care about compatibility. Although SHA1 has been cryptographically
  broken as a collision-resistant function, it is still perfectly safe for
  password storage with PBKDF2.

- `PBKDF2_ITERATIONS`: The number of PBKDF2 iterations. By default, it is
  32,000. To provide greater protection of passwords, at the expense of needing
  more processing power to validate passwords, increase the number of
  iterations. The number of iterations should not be decreased.

- `PBKDF2_SALT_BYTES`: The number of bytes of salt. By default, 24 bytes, which
  is 192 bits. This is more than enough. This constant should not be changed.

- `PBKDF2_HASH_BYTES`: The number of PBKDF2 output bytes. By default, 18 bytes,
  which is 144 bits. While it may seem useful to increase the number of output
  bytes, doing so can actually give an advantage to the attacker, as it
  introduces unnecessary (avoidable) slowness to the PBKDF2 computation. 144
  bits was chosen because it is (1) Less than SHA1's 160-bit output (to avoid
  unnecessary PBKDF2 overhead), and (2) A multiple of 6 bits, so that the base64
  encoding is optimal.

Note that these constants are encoded into the hash string when it is created
with `CreateHash` so that they can be changed without breaking existing hashes.
The new (changed) values will apply only to newly-created hashes.

Hash Format
------------

The hash format is five fields separated by the colon (':') character.

```
algorithm:iterations:hashSize:salt:hash
```

Where:

- `algorithm` is the name of the cryptographic hash function ("sha1").
- `iterations` is the number of PBKDF2 iterations ("64000").
- `hashSize` is the length, in bytes, of the `hash` field (after decoding).
- `salt` is the salt, base64 encoded.
- `hash` is the PBKDF2 output, base64 encoded. It must encode `hashSize` bytes.

Here are some example hashes (all of the password "foobar"):

```
sha1:64000:18:B6oWbvtHvu8qCgoE75wxmvpidRnGzGFt:R1gkPOuVjqIoTulWP1TABS0H
sha1:64000:18:/GO9XQOPexBFVzRjC9mcOkVEi7ZHQc0/:0mY83V5PvmkkHRR41R1iIhx/
sha1:64000:18:rxGkJ9fMTNU7ezyWWqS7QBOeYKNUcVYL:tn+Zr/xo99LI+kSwLOUav72X
sha1:64000:18:lFtd+Qf93yfMyP6chCxJP5nkOxri6Zbh:B0awZ9cDJCTdfxUVwVqO+Mb5
```

The hash length in bytes is included to prevent an accident where the hash gets
truncated. For instance, if the hash were stored in a database column that
wasn't big enough, and the database was configured to truncate it, the result
when the hash gets read back would be an easy-to-break hash, since the PBKDF2
output is right at the end. Therefore, the length of the hash should not be
determined solely from the length of the last field; it must be compared against
the stored length.
